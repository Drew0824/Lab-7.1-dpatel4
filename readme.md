# Introducing compound Boolean expressions

We can use logical operators in a Boolean expression to see if a number falls outside or inside of a range. 

Examine the code and run the program to see how it functions.

Modify the program so that instead of using the range of 1 to 100, it operates on a range of 1000 through 2000. 

It should also properly check to see if the input is within the "middle" (inner half) of the newly requested interval.
